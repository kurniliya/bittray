A system tray application for monitoring your BitBucket pull requests, written in Go.

# API Support

This version supports [Bitbucket REST API v1.0](https://docs.atlassian.com/bitbucket-server/rest/4.10.1/bitbucket-rest.html).

I do plan to update it to API 2, once I have a need. Non-breaking PRs to that end are welcome (but please file an issue).
