# Why did I do this?

## The Problem

I'm passionate about internal tooling. If I'm capable of making software that will delight a paying client, I ought to be
able to bring that same energy to my team to make their lives (and mine) easier.

I noticed one day that I had received 140 automated emails _from Jira alone_. Thanks to David Allen's [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), 
I've taken to simply acting on short tasks immediately. Most of our code reviews fall into that category and don't take much time.

But the number of emails generated by Jira is just too much to handle: one per action by any reviewer. In our team,
that amounts to an average of 5 per pull request, assuming nobody leaves any comments or comment Likes.

I wanted an inbox I didn't need to remember to consult, and wrote `Bittray` as a response to that.

## Learning New Technology

`Bittray` is written in [Go][1], and this site was produced using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the Ruby static site
generator.

I've been meaning to delve into [Go][1] for a while now, captivated by a few of Rob Pike's talks,
chiefly ["Concurrency is not Parallelism"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso). As a polyglot developer,
I'm always eager to learn other patterns, paradigms, and add to my toolbox.

## Let's be realistic

This is hardly revolutionary. It's a tiny tool I wanted for myself that I am sharing with my colleagues. Being an open-source
enthusiast, I'm also quite open to [developing new features based on user requests](https://github.com/michaelsanford/bittray/issues/new/choose).

Don't be shy to file an issue.
